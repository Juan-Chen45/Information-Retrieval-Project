# Information-Retrieval-Project

An financial news retrieval system in Python

Several ways to retrieve information is provided: Boolean Query , Vector Space Model , BM25 and Phrase Query

We also implement a correction of misspelling method , thanks to the idea of @Uyouii

The link of dataset selected is as follows:

When using the program , we just have to put the data in the directory IRProjectRawData
which I have already given some examples in.Then we run InitialData.py to clean and sort
the text and titles and bulid indices . Finally ,we can just run Window.py to get a GUI searching experience.
